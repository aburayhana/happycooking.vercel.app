- "Cover the bowl and place in the fridge to chill thoroughly for at least 2 to 3 hours or even overnight. Toss in between to distribute the dressing and add more seasonings or salt if needed. Serve chilled or at room temperature with additional dressing."
- "Note: You can use any kind of beans like northern beans, garbanzo beans or chickpeas, black beans etc. and add as much or as little as you want. Fresh green beans is a must. Add some grated carrots or any other vegetable you like for more colour and nutrition. If you like a sweeter salad, you can add more sugar or even honey. Substitute with any seasoning you like; oregano, roasted cumin powder, black salt etc. Another option is to add chopped dates instead of pomegranate."
