recipeingredient:
- "1 Tablespoon butter  1 Tablespoon oil"
- "1/2 a medium onion minced"
- "1 Tablespoon minced garlic about 2 large cloves"
- "1/2-1 teaspoon turmeric"
- "2 cups Jasmine rice"
- "1 cup coconut milk remember to shake it well in the can so all the solids incorporate with the liquid"
- "2.5-2 23 cup unsalted chicken or vegetable stock depending on how drywet you like your rice"
- "1-1.5 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "1 (15 oz.) can beans of choice rinsed and well drained dont get the unsalted for this recipe"
- " optional 2 sprigs thyme 1 Scotch Bonnet or Habanero chili pierced in several spots if you like more heat 12 teaspoon allspice"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a pot or large saucepan, melt the butter with the oil over a medium heat then add onion and garlic and sweat until the onions are translucent - maybe 3 to 4 minutes. Add the turmeric to the onions and garlic and stir to combine. (If you&#39;re going to add the optional flavorings, this would be the time.)"
- "Add the rice to the mixture and stir to combine. Toast the rice for 4 or 5 minutes in the pot, stirring occasionally to redistribute the grains on the top to the surface of the pan. You&#39;ll see the grains begin to turn opaque from the toasting. This process not only gives the rice a toastier flavor, but it also helps the individual grains retain their shape and texture."
- "Add the coconut milk and stock and stir to incorporate the liquid throughout the rice. Bring the heat up to medium high and bring to a gentle boil for about 2 minutes."
- "At that point, bring the heat down to just slightly higher than low and cover, lid slightly askew, until almost all the liquid is absorbed by the rice, and only the slightest bit of moisture is showing on the top."
- "Pour the beans in an even layer over the top, put the lid back on slightly askew, and continue to steam the rice until 5 minutes after all of the liquid has been absorbed."
- "Turn off the heat and let the rice sit for 5 to 10 minutes (and not much more) before fluffing the rice with a broad spoon or spatula while incorporating the beans as evenly as you can into it."
- "Enjoy alongside some finger lickin&#39; Jerk Chicken or some hearty and delicious oxtail stew."
