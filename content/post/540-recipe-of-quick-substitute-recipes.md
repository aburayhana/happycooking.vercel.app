Add the melted white sugar to the melted brown sugar and simmer, stirring often until thickens. Remove from heat and add in the butter and vanilla. Note: It will start to thicken quickly so serve immediately over pancakes or waffles (reheat if it thickens too much). Makes about 2 cups."
- "Mix both ingredients together well and store in an airtight container at room temperature until needed. (Makes 1 cup)"
- "Mix the warm water in with the sugar well, let it dissolve. Clear Honey is also a good substitute for light corn syrup."
- "Place the granulated sugar and water in a bowl, and stir until well combined. Then use it as honey replacement."
- "Use a knife to split the vanilla beans open lengthwise, stop one inch from the end of each bean. Place the cut beans in a glass container (i.e. jar), and cover with vodka. Make sure the beans are completely submerged in the vodka. Secure the lid and store in a cool, dark place.

Store in an airtight container in fridge and use with 4 days or a neat little trick is filling ice cube bags with the mixture and freezing, each cube is roughly 2 tablespoons."
- "Mix the ingredients well together. And replace the amount you need in your recipe."
