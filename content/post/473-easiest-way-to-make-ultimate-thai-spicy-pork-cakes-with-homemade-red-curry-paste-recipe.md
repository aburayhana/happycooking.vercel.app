It is a medium-spicy soup that gets it&#39;s color and spice from the use of dried red chilies that are made into a red curry. Very good recipe for pork curry. I opted to bring everything together in a skillet cover and simmer on the stovetop at medium-low heat instead of putting it in the oven. Use fragrant hot red curry paste as the base to this coconut curry dish with baby sweetcorn, coriander and soy, from BBC Good Food.
