Hoisin is a great all-purpose sweet and tangy sauce that can be used on its own or as a base of more complex sauces. Tonight&#39;s simple stir-fry combines chicken and tender bok choy in a delectably spicy, sweet sauce. On the side, as a counterpoint to the heat of the sambal oelek (a Southeast Asian ingredient made from red chiles), we&#39;re marinating cucumber with tart-sweet rice vinegar and nutty sesame oil. Add the vegetables+mushrooms, green peppers and stir-fry for another minute.
