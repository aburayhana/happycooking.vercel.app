recipeinstructions:
- "A - Soaked noodle in boiling water for few seconds and drain. Use both vermicelli and yellow noodles or use only one. Boil chicken thighs with garlic and enough water to cover the flesh. Once boil, take out the chicken from the broth. Keep this chicken broth for later. Put aside. Blanch fish cakes. Keep aside."
- "B. CURRY LAKSA PASTE - Blend all ingredients in B with 1/4 C of water (or just enough water) to make laksa paste. Keep aside. Prepare chicken broth from A by removing garlic used to boil the chicken. Keep aside."
- "C. CURRY LAKSA BROTH - combine and mix meat curry powder with enough water to get a thick curry paste."
- "D. THE ACCOMPANIMENTS - prep all the accompaniments."
- "COOKING THE LAKSA - Heat the wok. Add 7 tbsp of oil. Add ingredient B (laksa paste) Sauté until fragrant for few minutes. Next, Add meat curry paste, stir again until oil is separated from the paste."
- "Add chicken stock. Note/tip: if, at all, you have prawn heads, use them to make laksa broth by boiling them. 1 bowl of prawn head + 1 bowl of water. Once boiled, blend the whole thing, then strain to get enough broth. Use this in place of chicken stock or use both. Prawn head stock is optional but it surely the secret ingredient that most restaurants use to have a very rich taste of their broth and soups. I sometimes use both stocks to make my laksa broth. Leave this broth to simmer."
- "Next, Add cut chicken, simmer to cook the chicken. Pour thin or light coconut milk. Bring to boil. Add vietnamese mint/vietnamese corriander/laksa leaves. Add fish balls. Leave to boil over medium heat."
- "Note: Sambal Paste is served with laksa but its totally optional as some find it a bit spicy. It’s prepared by blending until fine 2 cups of soaked and softened dried chillies, few fresh chilies, 1 shallots, 1 medium brown onion, 2 thumb size of shrimp paste or belacan, pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp of sugar. Next, it is then fried in enough oil until fragrant and almost dried. The sambal is done. Serve a teaspon or a tablespoon with a bowl of curry laksa noodle."
- "Season broth with chicken stock granules/powder. Taste and add salt if necessary. Now add coconut cream. Stir and simmer before switching off the heat. Once coconut cream is added, simmering only take a very short time. Once broth starts to near boil, turn the heat off immediately."
- "Assemble everything in a big soup bowl in this order- noodles, curry laksa soup/broth, then add in D. Anyway, dont forget to Slice the fish cake. Serve with slice of lime/lemon and CURRY LAKSA SAMBAL (NOTE: the one pictured in the spoon)"
