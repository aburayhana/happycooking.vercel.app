recipeinstructions:
- "Add chopped potatoes, carrots, beans, capsicum, cauliflowers florets and green peas in a blender or food processor and grind them to a smooth paste. You can also boil al the vegetables and mash them."
- "Add grated Paneer along with finely chopped Green Chillies and Coriander Leaves."
- "Then add 1/2 Cup Besan (Chickpea Flour). This helps the vegetables to bind together. You can also use Bread Crumbs along with some Corn Flour instead of Besan for the binding."
- "Add Salt, Red Chilli Powder, Coriander Powder (Dhania Powder), Garam Masala, Amchur (Dry Mango Powder), Cumin Powder (Jeera Powder) and Black Pepper Powder (Kali Mirch)."
- "Mix all the ingredients well. You can add a little more Besan if the mixture seems too watery."
- "Divide the mixture into parts and make round lemon sized balls from it."
- "Heat oil for frying in a kadai or wok. The oil should not be too hot. Gently place the kofta ball in the oil and let it cook from one side. Do not turn it around till it is slightly cooked, otherwise it might break."

- "Add Salt, Red Chilli Powder, Turmeric Powder (Haldi), Coriander Powder (Dhania Powder), Cumin Powder (Jeera Powder) and Garam Masala and mix well."
- "Add the paste made from Cashew Nuts to the gravy. Roast the mixture till it starts to leave oil on the sides."
- "Add some Curd to the gravy. The Curd should not be too sour. You can also use Milk or Cream instead of the Curd."
- "Add water to the pan to adjust the consistency. If you will eat the Curry with Roti, or any other Indian bread, then the consistency should be slightly thicker. It should be thinner, if it will be eaten with Rice."
- "Add the Kofta balls to gravy just before serving and cook for 2 minutes. Serve hot with any Indian Bread or rice."
