And saying no to sweet corn was really out of the question. I do love this particular combination of soft potato bites, tender green beans, and crunchy sweet corn, but as the summer continues, I&#39;ll probably add zucchini and peanut-free. A spicy, fragrant peanut sauce reminiscent of the groundnut stews that are popular across West Africa anchors this recipe. Any protein would be lucky to be doused and marinated in it, but tofu soaks up the peanut sauce&#39;s flavors and chars up nicely upon roasting.
