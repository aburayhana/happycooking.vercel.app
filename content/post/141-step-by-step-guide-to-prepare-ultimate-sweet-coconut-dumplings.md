recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the filling. This time I used ‘Tsubu-an’ (Sweet ‘Azuki’ Red Bean Paste). Firm Custard is another very popular filling. Soft fillings are difficult to wrap with the dough. I recommend to make the filling into 16 balls, 2cm in size, and FREEZE them until hard enough to handle."
- "Place Glutinous Rice Flour, Rice Flour, Caster Sugar and Salt in a large bowl, stir to combine. Add Warm Water to the flour, mix and knead to achieve the firmness of dough same as firmness of your earlobe. (*This is traditionally taught.) Add extra water or extra flour to achieve this."
- "Divide the dough into 16 portions. Flatten one portion of the dough on your hand and place one ball of filling in centre and draw the edges up to enclose. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling."
- "Pour water into a steamer pan and bring to the boil over high heat. Line the bottom of the steamer with baking paper, place dumplings on the baking paper, cover with lid and steam for 10 minutes."
- "Place some Desiccated Coconut on a plate, roll cooked hot dumplings to coat with the Coconut."
- "Repeat with remaining dumplings. Serve warm."
